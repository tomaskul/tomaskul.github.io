# Placement
## Monday
I spend the first day getting introduced to the essential basics. Firstly, I met the software development team, and then rest of the company – far too many names & faces to remember for the first day. Whilst saying hi to everyone I was also shown around the company premises. With basics, out of the way, I spent rest of the day sorting out paperwork, laptop and familiarising myself with practices and software development culture within the team. Also, first visit to Chatwins!

## Tuesday
Tuesday was quite relaxing, yet intense on information intake. Spent good portion of the day reading (language agnostic code standards, development lifecycle, SVN, C# basics), being introduced to company products, and playing some (awful) game of pool. 

## Wednesday
Wednesday was the first day where I started feeling productive. Started the day off with my first contribution to the daily, team stand-up, learnt most of C# basics (variable types, operator overloading, anonymous (delegate) methods etc., essentially C# is a weird blend of C++ and Java with sprinkle of questionable feature naming). I finished the day in a meeting with Ralph (product customer) & Ian (senior software dev) getting a general outline of my first project!

## Thursday
Laid out project (high level user & functional) requirements, attended team meeting to see what is going on around the company outside the software dev team.

## Friday
Received feedback for the document I wrote on Thursday, improved the document and proceeded with writing up the technical requirements draft. Also, spent a fair bit of time just chatting away about MCU and RPGs and getting to know other members of the team

# Other
Spent few hours after work, on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday working on a 2D turn-based strategy game which I’ve been developing for ~2.5 weeks at that point. Most of the development was based around:

-  Refactoring
- Adding few mock classes, which later were fleshed out into usable base objects
- Incorporating property files
- Improving error/log messages
There are still quite the ways to go before I share the project, but it’s slowly coming along.

# Summary
All in all it was a good first week, few things to take away from it: need to learn to slow down and make sure that my approaches to problems are well defined, and structured, I need to get some extra pool practice under my belt, Chatwins may become my Subway replacement, and working week is more tiring than I remember it being
