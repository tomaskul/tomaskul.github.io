# Placement
## Monday
Started the week off by finishing the technical requirements for my project and began considering overall architecture of the project. Thought of some possible names (version control repo does need a name after all). Finished the day by investigating Windows Services as per how they work and how I could use them within the project.

## Tuesday
Tuesday included: 
-	Sketching out an E/R diagram of possible database which I would be using
-	Noting down questions to ask of the customer to identify any other potential things to prepare the system for
-	Looked into C# interop, which I may use within the project

## Wednesday
Mid-way of the week included some minor tasks such as sorting out expenses for EDT YINI travel which would take place on Thursday, getting some answers to the questions I noted down on Tuesday, writing a proof-of-concept Windows Service in C# and sketching out (Gliffy) the way the database I’m creating could interact with the data it will store.
Ian (Senior Software Dev.) suggested a relatively easy way of retrieving data in an organised manner, which I will most likely incorporate within the project.

## Thursday
On Thursday I travelled to EDT YINI Induction event at the University of Nottingham, and even though there were some issues (delayed train & late by an hour) I still had a great time. Met and talked to number of mentors, had some questions answered and grabbed a pizza by annual Nottingham ‘Beach’ before heading back.

## Friday
To finish of the working week, I made a start on requirement spec, outlining general tasks that will need accomplishing to complete the project, and when trying to structure a description for one of the tasks (about retrieval of data), I got side-tracked and with a little bit of help from James (software dev), and Ian (suggestion earlier in the week), I ended the day with a pretty solid idea of how to read the data, construct the queries and append it to the database.
Productive day, but not in the way I expected it to be.

# Other
Prior to my weekly bike ride, I didn’t change the tyre and half-way through my ~77km route my tyre gave in and I was left stranded in middle of nowhere (north west of Wrexham). Took me 3hours of walking before reaching the nearest train station and making it back to Chester.

During my spare time working on my own project I:
-	Decoupled some elements and made sure there were manager classes to handle slightly more complex behaviours within the game map
-	Fixed some logging messages
-	Added first troop/unit for testing purposes
-	Cleaned up some of the classes
-	Improved console debug view

# Summary
Overall the week has been quite interesting with a good amount of variability in how my time has been distributed and what I managed to accomplish.

**PS.** Forgot to mention that since midway through first week I’ve been using “Phabricator” and “Sharepoint” to track my placement project progress.

**P.P.S.** Change your bike tyres when they must be changed or suffer the consequences!
