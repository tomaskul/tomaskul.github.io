# Placement
## Monday
Started the week by walking the software team through my data structure from last week during morning stand-up. After my walkthrough, I received a suggestion which will help deal with the unpredictable & messy input data, and it was – scrap the 3NF inside the database.
Spent rest of the day carrying on working with the requirement spec (appears as though I’m still underestimating the amount of time things will take to get done) 

## Tuesday
Spent the day going through rest of the requirement spec. Even after acknowledging the importance of the documentation within the project from all sides (development, maintenance and having some support when asked about feature implementation or lack thereof), the task is still quite boring (not to undermine the importance of boredom – [watch this]( https://youtu.be/c73Q8oQmwzo)).

**Current pool record:** 2wins to 3losses

## Wednesday
Few more changes to the requirement spec., mapping out flowcharts which show the overall design of the project and prototyping database implementation and remembering how the tables and relationships are expressed.

## Thursday
Software flowcharts continued, more database table design (apparently, I use very old naming conventions – thanks for nothing 1<sup>st</sup> year DBI!).
I got told there was another year in industry student working at the company who was finishing her placement soon, so I went ahead and talked to her to see if I could get any pointers and advice. Key advice she gave me was to “be proactive”. Which I will hopefully follow through as time goes on.

## Friday
Few more minor changes to requirement spec. and more work on the system flowcharts. Personally, finding this type of *distanced* development approach quite boring and it *feels* like I am wasting time (one of the reasons being the almost undeniable fact that the documents will change in the future).

Note to self: going to sleep earlier and leaving for train on time would be great

# Other
During this week in terms of my personal project I did quite a bit of refactoring, added remainder of tiles, introduced alive/dead states to troops, introduced ‘tombstone’ into existing framework, removed ‘tombstone’ from initial location and added an additional aspect to the framework to handle dead troops better (i.e., possibly reviving them), added additional flag to animation class (it now can handle both vertically and horizontally laid out sprite sheets), fixed few bugs, and introduced very rudimentary tile selection via user input.

Started off my bank holiday weekend, with an easy 50km bike ride through the flat roads of Cheshire, during a pleasantly warm Friday (a coffee stop or two would be nice during next ride through the area) 

# Summary
The boredom caused due to documentation aside it was quite a good week 7.25/10.00
