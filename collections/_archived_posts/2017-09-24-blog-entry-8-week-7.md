# Placement
## Monday
Started the week off, by finally managing to get the DB design to work (yet to be tested). The meeting with client went well, the latest front-end design was well received, however I will still need to wait for feedback on the requirement spec for the project.

## Tuesday
Spent majority of the day trying to find issues in the DB design, attempted to make a little program to generate dummy data to be able to stress test the design (before realising there’s probably a generator already available).

## Wednesday
Most of Wednesday spent looking for holes and major flaws within the DB design, and began seeing whether I can easily fetch all the specific data values the system must provide.

That aside, I spent the day in one with one of the other devs in the room where the project he’s working on, is being tested (safety reasons mainly).

## Thursday
-	Rewrote my SQL queries to use JOINS as they’re supposedly faster than sub-queries, and began testing them both to find performance variance (in hindsight the tests I performed were absolute garbage, as I didn’t have nearly enough records within the DB to see any differences in performance – also realised my grounds for doubting that JOINs are faster, was based purely on the silly approach Uni lecturer use to encourage students to look into module subjects, which simply doesn’t work – for me at least)
-	Jeans for Genes fundraiser

## Friday
-	DB design flowchart updated within the implementation spec
-	Fixed project document stuff on Sharepoint
-	Built VS solution to contain most of the important “projects”, this project will require (in addition to implementing all the DB tables inside the project, opposed to the testing environment)
-	My first 2 commits to SubVersion project repo initialising the project!

# Other
-	Went to Costco for the first time (these places to actually exist outside of 90’s US!)
-	Provided some accommodation related pointers to a new YINI student joining the company next month
-	Did absolutely nil in terms of my personal project
-	Realised I can come-off as dick, in my attempts to being productive (**note to future self:** be more considerate of other people)
-	Finally finished reading “A Gift of Fire: Social, legal and ethical issues for computers and the Internet” by Sara Baase – A good book, even though lightly out of date, it still provides plenty valuable food for thought and things to consider for a computer professionals. I believe the book would have been of great value if I read It during, or prior to my first year at University.
# Summary
Relatively ok week – nothing particularly notable (aside from seeing that Costco’s actually exist!), however I’m pretty excited to finally start writing some code! Slightly disappointed I didn’t do anything in terms of my personal project, however catching up on sleep, keeping up the gym routine and attempting to catch up on my cycling quota took priority.
