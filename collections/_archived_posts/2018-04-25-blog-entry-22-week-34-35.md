# Placement Week 34 (9th Apr - 13th Apr)
I spent most of the week finalising the implementation of the  user grouping, which should (at least in theory) make page access and user management much easier. This is in addition to solidifying certain key aspects of the front end which I need to have in place (yay for doing *actual* work).

# Placement Week 35 (16th Apr - 20th Apr)
Throughout most of the week I have been going top-down through the views/controllers and starting to polish administrative pages, by doing things like;

- Making page layouts more consistent throughout the web app
- Only displaying necessary page elements (i.e. removing buttons which user doesn't have/shouldn't have access to)
- Cleaning up deprecated controller actions and methods.

## Design review (first front-end review)
Finally got around to doing the first design review of the front-end, got a lot of great feedback and with other people actually looking at the UI/UX that I'm constructing and pointing out many of the holes, I've finally got the motivation to get around to fixing some issues, which I've been putting off due to higher priority tasks and simply crossing them off the list (i.e. showing more user friendly names)

## JS
Towards end of the week whilst making the design review related changes I started to get back into writing Javascript, which I haven't really touched since implementing few basic drop downs at the start of the web app development (this reminds me - I also should clean up that code too!).

# Side note
Last couple of posts have been essentially afterthoughts, and it's difficult getting into routine of writing these posts, even if it's for my own benefit.
