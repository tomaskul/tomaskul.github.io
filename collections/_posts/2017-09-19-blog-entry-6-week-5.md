# Placement
## Monday
Working from home, began implementing some basic features of the project into a daemon, which lead down a rabbit hole of debugging. Luckily managed to fix the issue by magic before end of the day.

Really starting to dislike the way MS build their software.

## Tuesday
Flowcharts, mock ups, and a meeting with a Senior Dev and Senior Consultant (?) to go over the project details thus far and to get their feedback for possible improvements.

Arrived late – simultaneously too much & too little of Civ V

## Wednesday
-	Began putting together the implementation spec for the project
-	Wrote up my solution to the problem I fixed on Monday, within the projects’ Sharepoint page
-	Agreed on a temporary name for the project with the client

## Thursday
-	Almost completed the implementation spec
-	Proceeded to work on front-end mock ups
-	Read up on UoW and Repository patterns

## Friday
Spent the day updating the requirement spec to match changes discussed in the meeting (on Tuesday), and carried on making the front-end mock ups with restructuring of hierarchy of navigation within the website.

-	Arrived late on Tuesday and were pretty tired throughout most of the week, lowkey Civ V addiction really doesn’t do any good
-	No progress on personal project

# Summary
Overall quite a good week, remembered the value of sleep in ensuring that I am both productive and motivated throughout the day. However, the discovery that all the good I have heard about Civ V is true was also quite valuable.
