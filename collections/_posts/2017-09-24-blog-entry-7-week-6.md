# Placement
## Monday
Beginning of cycle to work week (unfortunately woke up too late, so I didn’t manage to cycle in…)! I also *correctly* uploaded the implementation spec to sharepoint, and then spent most of the day on it.
Additionally, asked for help to have UoW & repository patterns explained to me, as I didn’t fully understand how they worked.

## Tuesday
-	Organised a meeting with my client for next week to discuss the project
-	Worked on a new front-end mock up

## Wednesday
-	Front-end mock up
-	Rather pointless cycle to work scheme talk (considering I cycle quite regularly)
-	Received feedback on my implementation spec, and made amendments accordingly
-	Organised a meeting for Thursday to discuss some of the feedback, as it appears I may not be as good at expressing my ideas about the implementation as I believed I was

## Thursday
Meeting went well, and most of my concerns seemed to be just minor misunderstandings and ambiguous expressions I used. Apart from some clarifications the implementation spec is good. I also *attempted* at working with SQL server.

## Friday
Started the day by sending off my front-end mock ups to the client and asking for help in terms of how SQL Server Management Studio works (MS has some backwards ideas about GUI design, like why would a DB be represented in the same way as directory hierarchies are, and have been represented for as long as operating systems with GUIs have existed?).
Luckily, I managed to wrap my head around the poor UI (thanks Ian!) and started implementing my DB design.

# Other
-	Slowly getting back into shape, 120kg deadlift on Monday
-	Managed to hit 5<sup>th</sup> place on a local Strava segment
-	Starting to really notice that the weekly ‘team’ meetings are quite pointless in terms of productivity, even though they may be useful to the team leader
-	Worked on Saturday’s open day at UoN, simply helping students & their parents implementing a game of Pong. In addition to answering questions about my course and university in general

In terms of my own project, didn’t do much this week, but did start adding some unit tests and fool proofing my code base. This comes as I realised how much time & effort I waste tracking down issues upon modification of core elements of the project (i.e., reading/processing data inputs). 

Although this wouldn’t even be as big of an issue if I stopped meddling with smaller things which I already have figured out, and worked on aspects of the project I’ve been planning to for way too long.
Self-criticism aside, the unit tests are quite important and I suppose it’s greatly beneficial that I decided to start writing them before the codebase becomes too complex or simply too large.

# Summary
Overall, quite a good week with diverse number of things completed (or close to complete). Finally nearing the starting point for the project development.
