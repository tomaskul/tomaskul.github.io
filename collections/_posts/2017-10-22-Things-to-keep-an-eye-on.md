There's absolutely no surprise that there's always something new and exciting happening in field of technology and some of these things attract my attention from time to time. Most are forgotten about and end up fading into obscurity, others become prominent ideas or solutions which create entire industries.

So to ensure that I keep on top of it all (as much as I can anyway), without forgetting things of interest I'll be posting and updating these lists as much as I can.

# Security

- [OpenDXL](https://www.opendxl.com/) <sup>[GitHub](https://github.com/opendxl)</sup> : An initiative to create adaptive systems of interconnected services that communicate and share information for real-time, accurate security decisions and actions.

# Education

- [Public MIT courses](https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT/playlists) : This has been around for a while, however new content is added somewhat regularly, so definitely worthwhile to keep an eye on for free educational resources.
- [Links to CS courses and resources](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses) : Appears to be semi-regularly updated, has some valuable resources outlined

# Research

- [A Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithm for the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04215) : A paper on a "good-enough" TSP solution. As of adding this link, the paper is yet to be peer-reviewed.

# Mobile

- [Google's Flutter Beta 1 Announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/02/announcing-flutter-beta-1.html?utm_campaign=devshow_series_announcingflutterbeta_030918&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=yt-desc) : Details about resources and changes the framework brings to app development in Dart.

# AI

- [Evolutionary Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) : Subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection.
- [Neuro-Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution) : Form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate artificial neural networks parameters, topology, and rules. It is most commonly applied in artificial life, computer games, and evolutionary robotics

# Generally useful / Random

- [DevHints](https://devhints.io/) : Software development cheatsheets
- [Txt.fyi](https://txt.fyi/) : Dumbest publishing platform on the web
- [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/) : Subtle Patterns; perfect for website backgrounds
- [Fonts In Use](https://fontsinuse.com/in/2/formats/3/web) : Fonts
