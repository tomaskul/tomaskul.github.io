Read [part 1 here](http://tomaskul.github.io/2022/bikepacking-second-city-divide-pt1/). I thoroughly enjoyed first half of the route, finishing it, and having a chat about the experience with others over a pint sounded quite enticing to me. Working in 271km (>6000m of ascent) around a full time job meant it would be a long and tough weekend of riding.

# Friday 2nd - Back to the line
I've religiously stook to the line during initial attempt, so it was only right that I'd pick up _exactly_ where I left off (unfortunately, Stuart couldn't make it for this mad dash). To maximize my chances to reach the finish line and get back home in time, I booked a single night stay in the YHA Alston, which meant I could resume the route first thing in the morning.

First thing after work on Friday, I jumped on a train to Penrith (luckily no cancellations this time) [[^1]]. From there I followed C2C route over Hartside pass back into North Pennines AONB. Hostel is very accommodating of cyclists, clean and comfortable with friendly owners, would recommend it as a stop. After check-in I grabbed a hot pizza and some snacks for Saturday from near by shop/gas station.

# Saturday 3rd - The big'un
Poor night's sleep in anticipation of the day ahead made for an easy, pre-dawn wake up call. After a filling breakfast in a dark, hostel kitchenette, I was out on road - 5:38am.

Heading up Cross Fell was nice and gentle at fist, but as elevation rose, visibility declined (cloud sitting atop the moor might have something to do with it). Trail at times descended into a rock fall - not great for either riding nor hike-a-bike. This proved notably more difficult than anticipated, taking several hours to reach the peak. Descent wasn't much easier either. Steep hillside, with grassy winding path being quite treacherous in the wet (luckily visibility was improving due to strong winds). Swampy/marshy ponds scattered along the trail downhill bathed me and my bike in mud despite my best attempts at staying presentable. Mission failed successfully - several hours into the weekend.

Tracing the bottom of the hills was nice, even considering the headwind, things were quite smooth for a little while. 

That's when I rolled into an MOD firing range, red flags flying high didn't deter me, after all, I had a gpx to trust! Semi-automatic guns and rocket launcher (???) echoed in the distance as my dark, but clear thoughts ran through my mind. Sounds only got louder as I moved forward. Catching a glimpse of couple cars gave me hope (for a change). As I crested a hill, I encountered a small battalion of soldiers blocking the road. Luckily they were sound & let me through without a bullet through a tire. One of the soldiers even encouraged me as I rode past him.

From there on I slowly, but surely bonked on my way to Tan Hill Inn (highest pub in England), I managed to persevere and get up the main ascent, but thereafter any smallest incline would knock me off my tracks. I resorted to walking up little inclines and seeing roof of the inn felt like seeing an oasis in a desert. Unluckily for me I arrived far too early for lunch which meant while I rested, I wasted over an hour sat around waiting for kitchen to open.

General pub grub later, along River Swale I met Clare and Ed who were also riding SCD! (see below, me crossing ford near River Swale, Clare on the bridge, Ed the photographer). We shortly parted ways as I had just recovered and they were about to stop for a break. [[^2]]

Skip to Cam high road, a very long and barely ridable (at least with my 37mm tyres & no suspension) gravel track, high above anything in the surrounding vicinity. Here, rough and wet ~100km and thousands of meters of climbing later, I started feeling weary. Usual weariness was a given, but being halfway through the day without end anywhere in sight wasn't motivating with a fairly hard deadline. A top all this, I forgot to pack my padded gloves which I usually take with me on gravel/all-road trips to reduce hand and wrist fatigue.

# Reflections
- SCD FAQ "3 to 6 days - donâ€™t underestimate it" recommendation holds up. This isn't a route to take lightly, and is definitely best enjoyed at leisurely pace in good company.
- Midge repellent spray & a head net are definitely worth packing
- Bring reliable waterproofs

# Footnotes:
[^1]: **1:** Unlike initially, pacing was *very* important if I wanted to make it to the finish line with others still there. _Back to references:_
