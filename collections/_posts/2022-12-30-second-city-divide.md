A week before starting a new job and without any adventures/trips planned I chose [Second City Divide (SCD)](https://www.secondcitydivide.cc/) - a scenic ~600km "all-road" route from Glasgow to Manchester, packed my bags, booked a train ticket and set off. SCD has been on my radar for some time and has mostly been gathering dust, as one of those "some day" projects.

FAQ on the website mentions "3 to 6 days - don’t underestimate it". Having weighed up route length, amount of climbing, my fitness and (moderate) experience, and wish for a relaxed trip I earmarked 4-5 day completion.

# Part 1
I traveled from Liverpool Lime Street (LIV) to Glasgow Central (GLC) via change at Preston (£34.9 with a railcard) on Monday 25th of July. Because there was intentionally no real plan around timescales, cancellation of LIV -> PRE train and subsequent lack of bike spaces on PRE -> GLC service leading to a 3-4h change instead of original 20mins, didn't make much of a difference to me.

After arriving in Glasgow ~6pm, I bought abysmal fish and chips from a chippy around the corner from the station. Even whilst hungry, I barely managed to eat half of the portion. I began the ride ~18:38 with 2h of daylight remaining.

Start of the route was quite underwhelming, busy city and suburban roads lead to standard british farm roads, which lead to a dead-end road with several properties. This was first of many times I questioned the route. As it turned out, I had to wade through through waist high grass field behind someone's bad garden to reach rideable forest tracks.

Having learnt from [my midge bite mistakes last year](NC500), I applied anti-bug spray and threw on a head net (worth the investment!) as soon as I found something to lean my bike against. Riding through Whitlee wind farm was fun and definitely a good taster of what's to come later.

As I was exiting the grounds of the wind farm, it began to get dark, I was nowhere near either distance nor spot I intended on camping in when I left Glasgow. I precariously persevered for another hour and a bit, riding along sleepy towns and even beginning a gravel climb with limited visibility. Having found a quiet spot along a gravel track above Lanark decided to call it a day.
