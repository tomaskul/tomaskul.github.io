A week before starting a new job and without any adventures/trips planned I chose [Second City Divide (SCD)](https://www.secondcitydivide.cc/) - a scenic ~600km "all-road" route from Glasgow to Manchester, packed my bags, booked a train ticket and set off. SCD has been on my radar for some time and has mostly been gathering dust, as one of those "some day" projects.

FAQ on the website mentions "3 to 6 days - don’t underestimate it". Having weighed up route length, amount of climbing, my fitness and (moderate) experience, and wish for a relaxed trip I earmarked 4-5 day completion.

# Part 1
I traveled from Liverpool Lime Street (LIV) to Glasgow Central (GLC) via change at Preston (£34.9 with a railcard) on Monday 25th of July. Because there was intentionally no real plan around timescales, cancellation of LIV -> PRE train and subsequent lack of bike spaces on PRE -> GLC service leading to a 3-4h change instead of original 20mins, didn't make much of a difference to me.

After arriving in Glasgow ~6pm, I bought abysmal fish and chips from a chippy around the corner from the station. Even whilst hungry, I barely managed to eat half of the portion. I began the ride ~18:38 with 2h of daylight remaining.

Start of the route was quite underwhelming, busy city and suburban roads lead to standard british farm roads, which lead to a dead-end road with several properties. This was first of many times I questioned the route. As it turned out, I had to wade through through waist high grass field behind someone's bad garden to reach rideable forest tracks.

Having learnt from [my midge bite mistakes last year](NC500), I applied anti-bug spray and threw on a head net (worth the investment!) as soon as I found something to lean my bike against. Riding through Whitlee wind farm was fun and definitely a good taster of what's to come later.

As I was exiting the grounds of the wind farm, it began to get dark, I was nowhere near either distance nor spot I intended on camping in when I left Glasgow. I precariously persevered for another hour and a bit, riding along sleepy towns and even beginning a gravel climb with limited visibility. Having found a quiet spot along a gravel track above Lanark decided to call it a day.

# Part 2
Woke up near somme ruins and a fly tip site, sheltered from the wind. Early start ~7:30am, even in mid-Summer was chilly, but with rolling terrain and well paved surfaces was fast going. After ~10km I got a glimpse of wilderness to come; an uphill grass trail with fallen trees and waist tall grass in all directions between Howgate and Lochyock hills. En route I was followed by a bird of prey and deer bouncing in distant fields.

This was followed by a very fast gravel the paved road where I narrowly avoided road closure (diggers were unloading and worked arriving as I exited 'closed' road). Stopped in Crawford truckers stop for some late breakfast (full Scottish, tea and cake) where I met truck drivers who have been all over the world - definitely a worthwhile place to stop for food and a chat. Proceeded via wind farm behind Crawford where terrain was unforgiving and unrelenting, as fun as descends were, they didn't feel worth the climbs (especially into the headwind)...

When I initially investigated this route I hoped to stop at the Gameshope bothy for my first night, but since plans were scrapped I could ignore it, however having forgotten which turn to ignore en route I took an unnecessary detour before having to turn around, climb back down to valley floor, just to go back up via a horrid 25% climb. Fortunately views and descent that followed more than made up for the work.

Stopped for coffee at the Glen Café near St. Mary's Loch just before it shut for the day. Another infuriating up and over followed with some proper hike-a-bike sections. Then came another dead-end with .gpx pointing to another overgrown path into the forest. While unsure again I gave it a go before my path was cut off by fallen trees and a precarious walk down to a gravel track on the other side of the forest/tree plantation. Rough-stuff indeed.

At this point I was very tired and with daylight running short I found a patch of grass by a lovely stream another two hills later.
