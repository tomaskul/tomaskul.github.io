# Brief
### Brief

Final piece of my BSc degree was my year-long individual research project where I explored whether Return on Investment formula could be translated from its' application in ML to a genetic algorithm.

I chose Capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) as the optimization problem due to it being well defined, commonly researched problem within optimization and one which is ideal for testing new techniques on, as beneficial findings are usually transferable to more complex variants of the problem.


#### Methodologies
Agile + Scrum were obvious choices in terms of software development methodologies due to non-linear, exploratory nature of the project. During early stages of the project, I observed that I was falling behind my own schedule - as schedule didn't account for amount of time required to familiarize myself with the research subject. Stringent use Agile principles got me back on track and in time for submission deadline.

Test-driven development also became paramount in ensuring quality, and behaviour of code written and ability to quickly change directions.
