For those unfamiliar with Advent of Code, you can find out more [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about). In brief, it's a series of festive-themed programming challenges leading up to Christmas, with a new challenge revealed daily. Each day allows for 2 points to be collected for a total of 50. Before life and general festivities interrupted, I collected 17 stars. You can find source code for [my solutions here](https://github.com/tomaskul/advent-of-code-22).

As I had not long since learnt [Go programming language](https://go.dev/), this was a great, informal opportunity for me embed Go idiosyncrasies and tool chain into my mind. At the time of writing this, I'm likely to attempt this challenge next year and see if I can make it further!
