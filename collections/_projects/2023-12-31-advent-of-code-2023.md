For those unfamiliar with Advent of Code, you can find out more [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about). In brief, it's a series of festive-themed programming challenges leading up to Christmas, with a new challenge revealed daily. Each day allows for 2 points to be collected for a total of 50. Before life and general festivities interrupted, I collected 18 stars (1 more than year ago). You can find source code for [my solutions here](https://github.com/tomaskul/advent-of-code-23).
