During 2<sup>nd</sup> year of my degree, I picked an introductory module to programming in C++, and I was assigned to create a simple 
game using SDL2 showcasing my understanding of C++ principles and concepts (references, multiple inheritance, casts) and object-oriented 
principles. We were supplied a framework which was built on SDL2, which we had to use to give the project an additional level of complexity of working with existing code base. However, we weren't allowed to modified the supplied framework to meet the requirements (except for an object container).

Some of the key coursework requirements included: multiple screens, user controlled object, animated/scrollable background, modification of the supplied frameworks approach to storage and access to objects. By the end I had created a very basic prototype for a shoot 'em up/
bullet hell (En.wikipedia.org, 2017) style game.

I met most of the requirements getting 60% of the marks. Although the prototype has been pretty terrible, it did help me solidify my C++
understanding, learn about SDL2, and allow me to implement things such as; vector object container, class hierarchies and object 
factories in a programming language, which I wasn't completely familiar with.
