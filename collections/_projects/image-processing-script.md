During 2<sup>nd</sup> year of my degree, I picked an introductory module to image processing. And I had to create a simple image processing script which implemented some of the core image processing principles, in order to generate a binary image from a small set of pictures of plants. Image above shows one of the original plant images alongside the output my script produces.

Although my script was simple, relatively fast and used toolkit functionality there were number of issues with my implementation such as it not being 100% reliable (script struggles dealing with shadows, and certain shades of green), more than ideal amount of noise makes it to the output image and few other minor problems.
