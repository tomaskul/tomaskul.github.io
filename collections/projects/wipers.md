A college project where I was tasked with following waterfall software development model and producing an educational video game based on a WW1 event.

I chose 2nd battle of Ypres. Wipers (The English speaking soldier prenounciation of the town's name) is a top down shooter with focus on educating players about the events that took place during this battle (i.e., first mass use of poison gas by Germany on the Western Front).
